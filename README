FAQ:

What is it called?
dbf2sql v0.99

What does it do?
It converts FoxPro, dBase files with dbf extension to sql scripts that can be imported in MySQL Database.

What actually is it?
dbf2sql is a php script that runs on console, not browser.

What are its Requirements?
PHP should be installed.
You must know what a console is, and how you basically use it?

How do I use dbf2sql?
Extract files from the dbf2sql package. db2sql and dbf_class.php are the required files.
Fire up console.
Change directory to where you have extracted the files.
Execute "php dbf2sql.php input.dbf tablename output.sql"
where 'input.dbf' is assumed to be the dbf file to be converted, 'tablename' is the name of the table to be cerated in MySQL database,
'output.sql' is the output file to be generated.

"php dbf2sql.php input.dbf myData"
Since, output file name isn't given, 'myData.sql' would be generated.

"php dbf2sql.php data.dbf"
This would create 'data.sql' script that would create a table named 'data'.


Sorry for any bad English encountered, because my mother tongue NEPALi is.
